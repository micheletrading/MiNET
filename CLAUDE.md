# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

MiNET is a Minecraft: Bedrock Edition server written in C#, targeting .NET 10. The solution lives at `src/MiNET/MiNET.sln`; everything is under `src/MiNET/`. The current protocol target lives in `MCPE Protocol.xml` (currently protocol 1001, game 1.26.34).

Naming note: the edition is Minecraft: Bedrock Edition ("Bedrock"). The `Mcpe`/`MCPE` prefix all over the code and filenames (`McpeProtocolInfo`, `MCPE Protocol.xml`, the `Mcpe*` packet classes) is legacy from the Pocket Edition era and stays, it's baked into the codebase, but "Bedrock" is the edition in prose.

## Commands

```bash
# Build the whole solution
dotnet build src/MiNET/MiNET.sln

# Run all tests (MSTest)
dotnet test src/MiNET/MiNET.Test/MiNETTests.csproj

# Run a single test
dotnet test src/MiNET/MiNET.Test/MiNETTests.csproj --filter "FullyQualifiedName~PacketTests"

# Run the server (reads server.conf from the working directory)
dotnet run --project src/MiNET/MiNET.Console
```

CI (`.github/workflows/dotnetcore.yml`) builds and packs only the core `MiNET` project and pushes it to NuGet on every push to master.

## Projects

- `MiNET` - the core server library and the NuGet package. Everything below refers to this project.
- `MiNET.Console` - console host that boots `MiNetServer`. Configured via `server.conf` (key=value, read through `MiNET.Utils.Config`).
- `MiNET.Client` - a Bedrock client/bot used to trace and reverse-engineer the protocol against a real server (e.g. vanilla BDS). `BedrockTraceHandler` dumps packets; this is the main tool when updating protocol versions.
- `MiNET.ServiceKiller` - load-test emulator that spawns many fake clients.
- `TestPlugin`, `MiNET.Plotter`, `MiNET.BuilderBase` - example/real plugins loaded at runtime (see plugin system below).
- `MiNETTests`, `MiNET.BuilderBase.Tests` - MSTest projects.

## Protocol layer (the important part)

Most work in this repo is keeping up with Mojang protocol changes. The network code in `MiNET/Net/` is largely generated:

- `MCPE Protocol.xml` is the source of truth: packet definitions, ids, fields, and the protocol/game version.
- `MCPE Protocol.tt` (T4 template) generates `MCPE Protocol.cs` from the XML; `MCPE Protocol Documentation.tt` generates the markdown protocol spec. Both outputs are committed. Regenerate after editing the XML, either via the Visual Studio design-time custom tool or the `dotnet-t4` CLI: `cd src/MiNET/MiNET/Net && t4 "MCPE Protocol.tt" -o "MCPE Protocol.cs"` (same for the documentation template).
- Never hand-edit `MCPE Protocol.cs`. To customize a packet beyond what the XML expresses, add a partial class in its own file (e.g. `Net/McpeAnimate.cs`): declare extra fields there and implement the `partial void AfterDecode()` / `AfterEncode()` hooks, which run after the generated fields. Fields that need conditional or custom encoding are left out of the XML entirely and handled in the partial.
- Machine-readable protocol references, in priority order for a specific target version:
  - PrismarineJS/minecraft-data (`data/bedrock/<version>/protocol.json`, ProtoDef) is version-exact, so it is the primary reference for whatever version the XML targets. It is community-maintained and does have occasional field errors.
  - Mojang's official docs repo (github.com/Mojang/bedrock-protocol-docs, JSON Schemas) is authoritative for field semantics and wire order (via `x-ordinal-index`), but it only publishes the single current protocol, which is usually AHEAD of the version we target. Use it to cross-check, and when the two disagree trust Mojang and note it.
  - Live BDS bytes are the ground-truth tiebreaker. Zero leftover bytes proves byte alignment, not field meaning.
- `McpeProtocolInfo.ProtocolVersion` / `GameVersion` (generated from XML attributes) gate client connections.

### Updating the protocol (the working loop)

Protocol updates are done by reverse-engineering against a real vanilla BDS, in a strict ping-pong loop. `MiNET.Client` is the tool: point it at a running BDS (`Startup.cs`, default `127.0.0.1:19132`) and trace.

1. Our client -> BDS: parse EVERY server->client packet with zero unknown ids, zero leftover bytes, zero decode exceptions, and record the packet ORDER. Do NOT skip or leniently swallow a packet you can't parse: an unrecognized or unparseable packet is the signal to stop and fix it, not move on. Unknown ids surface as `Unknown packet with id N` (decimal), decode failures as `Error parsing bedrock message ... id=N`, leftovers as `... Still have N` in `minetlog.log`.
2. Implement the fix (XML pdu + regenerate, per above).
3. Our client -> MiNET server: confirm MiNET emits the same packets, same order, same 1.26 formats.
4. Real Bedrock client -> MiNET server: reach spawn, and watch for packets the real client sends that we don't expect, or order differences.

Stale-binary trap: building `MiNET.csproj` alone does NOT refresh `MiNET.Console/bin` or `MiNET.Client/bin`, so you end up running old code. Always build the SOLUTION (`dotnet build src/MiNET/MiNET.sln`) before running the server or client.

Generated code also defines `IMcpeMessageHandler` (server-side handling) and `IMcpeClientMessageHandler` (client-side). `Player` implements `IMcpeMessageHandler`; `MiNET.Client` handlers implement the client interface.

### Transport stack

`Net/RakNet/` is a full RakNet implementation: `RakConnection` (UDP socket + offline handshake via `RakOfflineHandler`), `RakSession` (reliability, ordering, ACK/NAK, datagram split/reassembly). Above that sits `BedrockMessageHandler` (`ICustomMessageHandler`): batching (`McpeWrapper`), compression, and encryption. Flow for an incoming connection:

`MiNetServer` -> `RakConnection` -> `RakSession` -> `BedrockMessageHandler` -> `LoginMessageHandler` (XBL auth, encryption handshake, spawns a `Player` via `PlayerFactory`) -> `Player.HandleMcpe*` methods.

Packets are pooled (`ObjectPool` in `Net/`); `Packet.CreateObject()`/`PutPool()` manage reuse. Be careful with packet lifetime when handling or forwarding them.

## World and game layer

- `LevelManager` owns `Level` instances; `Level` runs the game tick (block ticking, entities, players, time).
- Chunks: `ChunkColumn` -> `SubChunk` (16x16x16, paletted block storage).
- World storage is pluggable via `IWorldProvider`: `AnvilWorldProvider` (Java Anvil format), `LevelDbProvider` (Bedrock LevelDB format), plus in-memory generators (`SuperflatGenerator`, `CoolWorldProvider`, etc.).
- Blocks and items are data-driven from embedded resources in `Blocks/Data/` and `Items/Data/` (canonical block states NBT, id maps, legacy mappings). `BlockFactory`/`ItemFactory` resolve runtime ids.
- The block/item classes in `Blocks/` and `Items/` are themselves generated by the `[Ignore]`d "tests" in `MiNET.Test/GenerateBlocksTests.cs` and `GenerateMobsTests.cs`. When new game versions add blocks/items, update the data files and run those manually to emit new class code.

## Plugin system

`PluginManager` scans assemblies in `PluginDirectory` (from `server.conf`). A plugin is a class with `[Plugin]` and/or implementing `IPlugin` (`OnEnable(PluginContext)`). Extension points: `[PacketHandler]` methods to intercept packets, `[Command]` methods for chat commands (permissions via `[Authorize]`). `TestPlugin` is the reference example.

## Conventions

- `.editorconfig` is authoritative: tabs for indentation, C# with Allman braces, `_camelCase` instance fields, PascalCase constants. UTF-8 BOM, no final newline.
- Every source file carries the CPAL license header; keep it in new files.
- Code style follows the existing ReSharper setup; match surrounding code rather than reformatting.
